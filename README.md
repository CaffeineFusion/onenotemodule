# onenotemodule
Npm module to allow hook into Microsoft OneNote

***Please Note: This module is currently non-functioning. I've gutted the Microsoft example and started rebuilding it but have not it brought it back up to functioning yet.***


When testing the module, you will need to add a config.js file with appropriate creds as per:

```module.exports = { //Live Connect API information clientId: '000000004011C945', clientSecret: 'U5ofKaQiol75VbohV4hh-2x8XZpcJoPf ', redirectUrl: 'http://onenoteapisamples.com:3000/callback' };```

* note, test harness has not been added yet.
